Test Cases- Workload E and F


Workload E:


In workload E, malloc is called 75 times in a loop, and in each loop iteration the memory size allocated increases by 1 byte. Example: 1st iteration - malloc(1), 2nd iteration - malloc(2)...nth iteration- malloc(n).
All of the blocks are kept track of throughout the time that malloc is being called. 
Afterwards, free is called 75 time in a loop, such that during each iteration, one block is randomly freed. After 75 iterations, all blocks will be freed. 


Workload F:


In workload F, 10 mallocs are called with a malloc size of 10 bytes each and 5 frees are called which then randomly free one block. This sequence runs 15 times.At the end all of the blocks should be free
